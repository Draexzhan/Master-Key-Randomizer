# Master Key Randomizer
 A Randomizer for the indie game Master Key.
This randomizer is still in Alpha. You may encounter bugs while playing.

# Installation
Download either the .zip with BepInEx or the .zip without it. If you do not already have BepInEx installed, or you don't know which one you should download, download the BepInEx one.

Unzip the contents into the folder with your Master Key executable and run the game.

If done correctly, the title screen should say "Randomizer" on it, and you should have a menu for randomization options in the top left of your screen.

# Playing a randomized world
The randomization window displays the stats for the current world, as well as its seed number. These numbers will be 0 if the file is empty or corrupt. You can set the save number to any positive number of your choice. These saves do not conflict with the vanilla saves and will not overwrite them. In v0.1.0.0, the vanilla saves can also be used for randomized worlds, however, in all other versions, the vanilla saves can only be used for non-randomized games.
**This mod is Vanilla-safe on v0.1.0.1 and later.**

If a save is corrupt, you may need to erase it, even if the displayed numbers are all 0.

# Spoiler logs
Spoiler logs are generated automatically upon world creation. You will find them in AppData/LocalLow/Achromi/Master Key/SpoilerLogs
