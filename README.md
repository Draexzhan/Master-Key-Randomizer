# Master Key Randomizer
 A Randomizer for the indie game Master Key
This randomizer is still in Alpha. You may encounter bugs while playing.

# Installation
Download either the .zip with BepInEx or the .zip without it. If you don't know which one you should download, download the BepInEx one.

Unzip the contents into the folder with your Master Key executable and run the game.

If done correctly, the title screen should say "Randomizer" on it, and you should have a button in the top left corner of your screen that opens a menu for randomization options.

# Playing a randomized world
The randomization window displays the stats for the current world, as well as its seed number. These numbers will be 0 if the file is empty or corrupt. You can set the save number to any positive number of your choice. These saves do not conflict with the vanilla saves and will not overwrite them. Currently, the vanilla saves can also be used for randomized worlds, however, the eventual plan is to relegate them to the Vanilla game exclusively, so any seeds attached to them may become inaccessible in a later update.

If a save is corrupt, you may need to erase it, even if the displayed numbers are all 0.

# Spoiler logs
Spoiler logs are generated automatically upon world creation. You will find them in AppData/LocalLow/Achromi/Master Key/SpoilerLogs
